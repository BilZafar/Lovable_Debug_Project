## Overview

This document details several issues that were found and corrected in the  
Lead Management & Scheduling App.

---

### 1. Wrong Array Selection in AI Output

**File**: `src/services/aiHandler.ts`  
**Severity**: Critical  
**Status**: Fixed

#### Behavior Noted

AI-generated responses often defaulted to fallback text instead of delivering the intended answer.

#### What Caused It

The code was retrieving `choices[1]` from the API response rather than the correct `choices[0]`.

#### Change Implemented

Adjusted the index to `[0]` to consistently fetch the proper AI content.

#### Outcome

- ✅ Users now see correct AI responses
- ✅ Fallback text rarely appears
- ✅ Improved trust in AI outputs

---

### 2. Missing Industry Field

**File**: `src/types/Lead.ts`  
**Severity**: Critical  
**Status**: Fixed

#### Behavior Noted

The `industry` value submitted in forms never reached the database.

#### What Caused It

The `Lead` interface did not contain the `industry` property, resulting in dropped data.

#### Change Implemented

Added the missing property to the interface to match form inputs.

#### Outcome

- ✅ All submitted fields are now preserved
- ✅ Accurate analytics possible
- ✅ Data consistency between frontend and backend

---

### 3. Deprecation Warnings from React Router

**File**: `src/routes/routerConfig.ts`  
**Severity**: Minor  
**Status**: Fixed

#### Behavior Noted

React Router displayed warnings about missing v7 “future flags.”

#### What Caused It

`startTransition` and `relativeSplatPath` were absent from the configuration.

#### Change Implemented

Added the required flags to eliminate warnings.

#### Outcome

- ✅ No distracting console logs
- ✅ Compatible with future Router versions

---

### 4. No Database Persistence

**File**: `src/services/databaseService.ts`  
**Severity**: Major  
**Status**: Fixed

#### Behavior Noted

Leads would vanish after page reloads, as they were only stored locally.

#### What Caused It

The form submission process lacked a call to insert the lead into Supabase.

#### Change Implemented

Added a database insert step after form submission.

#### Outcome

- ✅ Leads now saved permanently
- ✅ Eliminated accidental data loss
- ✅ Improved backend reliability

---

### 5. Unnecessary useEffect Hook

**File**: `src/components/LeadForm.tsx`  
**Severity**: Minor  
**Status**: Fixed

#### Behavior Noted

A `useEffect` was running on mount without serving any real function.

#### What Caused It

Legacy code from an older version was left in place.

#### Change Implemented

Removed the hook entirely to streamline the component.

#### Outcome

- ✅ Reduced unnecessary rendering logic
- ✅ Slight boost in performance
